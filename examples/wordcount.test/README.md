The application is organized as a small, single‑file Ruby script that defines two classes: `App` and `FileCounter`.  `App` is responsible for parsing command‑line arguments, handling the default instructions file, and coordinating the overall flow.  `FileCounter` encapsulates the logic for opening a file in read‑only mode, counting lines and words, and returning the results.  The script uses only the Ruby standard library, so no external gems are required.
