Build a command line application in Ruby that implements the 'FizzBuzz' function.
The function takes one integer argument 'i'. It should print 'Fizz' if i is divisible by 3. It should print 'Buzz' if i is divisible by 5. And print 'FizzBuzz' if i is divisible by 15.

Run the FizzBuzz function with all integers from 1 to 100.
